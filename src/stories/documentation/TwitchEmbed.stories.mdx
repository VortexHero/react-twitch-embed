# TwitchEmbed

This component frames an embed that can embed a stream with its chat, VODs and collections.
It is an interactive component, meaning that it exposes its underlying API through the `onVideoReady` event
that can be used to control the player from the outside (i.e. custom control components).

## Props

The following props are supported by this component:

| Name              | Type                                                        | Required | Default                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allowFullscreen` | **boolean**                                                 | ❌        | `true`                     | Whether the player allows fullscreen to be played in fullscreen mode. Disabling this also removes the fullscreen button from the player.                                                                                        |
| `autoplay`        | **boolean**                                                 | ❌        | `true`                     | Whether the content should autoplay on load. Keep in mind that the audio might not play unless the user has focused at least once on the player.                                                                                |
| `channel`         | **string**                                                  | ❌        |                            | The name of the channel to embed their stream.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `video`           | **string**                                                  | ❌        |                            | The ID of the video to embed.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `collection`      | **string**                                                  | ❌        |                            | The ID of collection to embed. If both `video` and `collection` are provided, the player will play the provided collection while starting with the provided video.                                                              |
| `withChat`        | **boolean**                                                 | ❌        | `true`                     | Whether the embed should include the live chat or not. This setting is only applied when `channel` is provided. There are no chat options for VODs.                                                                             |
| `muted`           | **boolean**                                                 | ❌        | `false`                    | Whether the content should start muted when playing. The user can still change the volume later.                                                                                                                                |
| `parent`          | **string &#124; string[]**                                  | ❌        | `window.location.hostname` | The URL of the site that is embedding this player. Multiple values can be added. You don't need to specify this as the current hostname is already picked up by the underlying API.                                             |
| `darkMode`        | **boolean**                                                 | ❌        | `true`                     | Whether the chat embed should be displayed in a dark or light theme.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `time`            | **string**                                                  | ❌        | `0h0m0s`                   | The timestamp from where the content should play. If a `channel` is provided then this setting is ignored. Should be a string formatted like `XhYmZs` for an X hour, Y minute and Z second timestamp.                           |
| `hideControls`    | **boolean**                                                 | ❌        | `false`                    | Whether the player controls should be hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `onAuthenticate`  | **(e: TwitchEmbedInstance, d: OnAuthenticateData) => void** | ❌        | `() => void`               | This event is fired when the embed authenticates the client through their stored credentials in the browser.                                                                                                                    |
| `onVideoPlay`     | **(e: TwitchEmbedInstance, d: OnPlayData) => void**         | ❌        | `() => void`               | This event is fired when the player starts playing or resumes content.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `onVideoPause`    | **(e: TwitchEmbedInstance) => void**                        | ❌        | `() => void`               | This event is fired when the player pauses.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `onVideoReady`    | **(e: TwitchEmbedInstance) => void**                        | ❌        | `() => void`               | This event is fired when the player embed is ready. Use this if you need to keep track of the embed instance. Updating certain props might trigger a recreation of the embed, so this event should keep track of those changes. |
| `id`              | **string**                                                  | ❌        | `twitch-embed`             | The ID of the `div` node where the player will be mounted. The underlying API uses this. You should not use an ID that depends on the channel name because it will trigger recreations of the player unnecessarily.             |
| `height`          | **string &#124; number**                                    | ❌        | `480`                      | The height of the embed. Percentage values can be used (i.e `100%`).                                                                                                                                                            |
| `width`           | **string &#124; number**                                    | ❌        | `940`                      | The width of the embed. Percentage values can be used (i.e `100%`).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `...props`        |                                                             |          |                            | The rest of the props are passed to the underlying `div` node.                                                                                                                                                                  |

> **Note**: If `channel`, `video` and `collection` are provided, only `channel` is taken into account.
> If `collection` and `video` are provided, the player will play the videos in the collection starting from the video that was provided.
> If the collection doesn't contain the video, the player might enter an undefined state where one of the following may happen.
>
> 1. The player might start playing the video provided while saying that is playing the collection provided, even if the video isn't part of the collection.
> 2. The player might start playing the collection provided while ignoring the video (the official docs mention that this is the default behavior, but I've seen the others happen, so it isn't 100% certain).
> 3. The player might remain black and not play anything.

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { TwitchEmbed } from 'react-twitch-embed';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const embed = useRef(); // We use a ref instead of state to avoid rerenders.
  
  const handleReady = (e) => {
    embed.current = e;
  };
  
  return (
    <TwitchEmbed channel="moonstar_x" autoplay muted withChat darkMode={false} hideControls onVideoReady={handleReady} />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
